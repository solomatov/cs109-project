    <h1>Can you trust doctor Robot?</h1>
    <p>
      It's late in the week and work is piling up. You run down the escalator to catch the northbound
      tube. Anchovised with your fellow commuters you catch your breath when you feel a sudden chest
      pain. At the same time you get nauesous and your vision just blurs until you pass out.
    </p>
    <p>
      You wake up just as the ambulance enters Central ER, feeling a little dizzy you still have all your
      senses. At arrival you are welcomed by a shiny new doctor robot from Healthy Hearts Tech. A paramedic
      takes a brief look at you and adjusts a bar on the robots touchscreen brightly labeled ROC
      sensitivity before running to the next patient. As the robots commences it's examination of you
      the paramedic leaves and you get some final advice: "If it starts to stutter just press the big
      red button.

  <h1 id="Intro">Project Introduction</h1>
  <h2>Brief</h2>
  <p>
    When patient arrives into a hospital's ER, medical personnel has important decisions to make. Some
    patients should be discharged immediately, some could wait, and some should be attended by a doctor
    immediately.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here's a sample dashboard that is displayed on a large wall screen in the ER department. The dashboard
    shows the number patients on each workflow stage.
  </p>
  <img src="images/screen.png" width="900px" />
  <p>
    The stages are the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Waiting</li>
    <li>Present
      <ul>
        <li>Present: More than 8h</li>
        <li>Ready but in need of further hospital care</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Our Goals</h2>
  <p>
    We want to use machine learning methods to predict as early as possible whether a person coming into ER
    will require hospitalization. There's a trade off here. On one hand, we want to minimize a number of hospitalized
    patients, hospitalization is very expensive and saving money will let the hospital to provide care in more
    important areas. On the other hand, we don't want to send home a patient who will have a complication, or worse
    die because of this. Human life and health are priceless.
  </p>

  <h1 id="Method">Method</h1>
  <h2>Data Gathering</h2>
  <p>
    Our data set is the ER log, also called akutliggaren.  In the ER log patients are tracked from when
    they enter the ER until they exit the ER. The data in the ER log have been extracted from the hospital's
    main system for  keeping electronic medical records and covers the majority of the ER wards in the
    reception area.
  </p>
  <h2>EDA</h2>
  <p>
    The Er Log the project has access to has 100+ fields and one defensive initial idea are to focus on the triage
    data. The first examination plus the medical history of the patient are what nurses and doctor are using to assess
    the status of a patient and also to give a patient an initial priority. Many Swedish hospital is using Retts
    (<a href="http://predicare.se/en/om-retts/">http://predicare.se/en/om-retts/</a>) decision support system for emergency medicine when assessing the patients and
    at the time of assessment a number of vital parameters are collected.
  </p>
  <p>
    In that way the project piggy rides on the domain knowledge of the organisation and try to use features that they
    use. We will see if that is a good or bad idea, but we can always extend with more features later on. We only have
    access to the ER log and not the medical history of the patients and there already from the beginning we have some
    limitations that most probably will affect the precision of our predictions. In addition to that we do not get the
    “touch and feel” a nurse and doctor get’s when talking to a patient, they can use their hands to feel body
    temperature, sweating and pinpoint things like abdominal pains etc.
  </p>
  <p>The vital parameters that we have access to are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Breathing frequency</li>
    <li>Saturation Status</li>
    <li>Body temperature</li>
    <li>Bllodpressure Systolic Upper</li>
    <li>Blood pressure Systolic Lower</li>
    <li>GCS Eye opening Status</li>
    <li>GCS Motoric Status</li>
    <li>GCS Verbal Status</li>
    <li>Stridor Status</li>
    <li>Pulse frequency regular</li>
    <li>Pulse frequency irregular</li>
    <li>Consciousness Retts scale status</li>
    <li>Saturation with oxygen status</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In addition to that we will use patient Age. It seems that ER visits highly depend on the month, day of week,
    and hour of day, so we will add these features as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    We aim to predict if a patient will need further care and become an Inpatient. We have two categories: Others and
    Inpatients. Others include people going home and outpatients. The main difference between an outpatient and an
    inpatient from a hospital logistics perspective is that the inpatients stays overnight and requires more resources.
    An outpatient may have an appointment at the hospital for example the following day or a week later for check up but
    their direct interaction (and use of resources) with the hospital is relatively brief.
  </p>
  <p>
    On this chart we display a
    bar chart of number of inpatients vs others by year:
  </p>
  <img src="images/inpatient-others.png" />
  <p>
    As we see, there're much more others than inpatients.
  </p>
  <p>
    On this chart we display histograms of different variables by inpatient/other status:
  </p>
  <img src="images/dists.png" />
  <p>
    As we see, there's a difference in distribution in almost all variables. This gives us a promise that we can
    predict whether the patient will be inpatient or outpatient.
  </p>

  <h1 id="Analysis">Analysis</h1>
  <p>
    As a baseline, we will use the model which sends all patients home. It's correct in about 80.1% of the cases.
    This model is very imprecise, and doesn't take into account the cost of lost lifes and health, as well as cost
    of the treatment, but it's ok as a baseline.

  <h2>ML Method Selection</h2>
  <p>
    We've chosen the following models
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Decision trees. They are know to work quite well for data with missing values which we have here</li>
    <li>Random forests. They are basically decision trees with lower variance</li>
    <li>Gradient boosting. They are another improvement on decision trees with lower variance</li>
    <li>Logistic Regression.</li>
    <li>Linear SVM (data set is very large and using kernelized SVM isn't good idea here)</li>
  </ul>
